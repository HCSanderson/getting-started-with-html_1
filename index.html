<h1> Lesson 1: Web Basics and Getting Started </h1>

<b> <u>Web Basics </u> </b>

<p></p> <b> The Web </b> is a collection of HTML documents. <br><b> HTML </b> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br> <b> URLs </b> are a series of hyperlinks that connect the HTML documents together. <br> <b> Browser </b> makes requests via the Internet to Servers using <u> HTTP</u>, the main protocol of the Web. For example, IE, FF, & Chrome. 
<p></p>
<b> HTML </b> is made up of:<br> <u>Text content</u>: what you see 
<br> <u> Markup</u>: How text content is arranged; it references to other documents, like images and videos. (They are tags!)
Together, an opening <name> and closing tag </name> are called an element.</p>

<b> <u> Communicating with Computers </u></b>

<p> When programmers say that computers are "stupid" they're not insulting computers. They are addressing an important point about how computers understand the instructions that human programmers give them. For example, if you do not have an end tag, the command of the opening tag will continute until you close it.</p>

<b> <u> Links to Connect HTML Documents to Any Other Documents on the Internet (aka HTML Attributes) </u> </b>

<p> </p><a href = "www.reddit.com"> derp </a> </p>

HREF = hypertext reference
<p> To insert images you would use the following formula: <img scrc = "url" alt "text">
